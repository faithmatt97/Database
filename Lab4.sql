-- 8. Tell	me	about	check	constraints:	What	are	they?	What	are	they	good	for?	Whatâ€™s	the	
--advantage	of	putting	that	sort	of	thing	inside	the	database?	Make	up	some	examples	
--of	good	uses	of	check	constraints	and	some	examples	of	bad	uses	of	check	constraints.	
--Explain	the	differences	in	your	examples	and	argue	your	case.

--Check constraints are used to limit the range of a value in a column. They're good for enforcing integrity by limiting the values taken by a column. An example of a good check constraint is making the range of salary 9.00 to 100,000.00. This way, you can't accidently enter a number below the minimum or above the maximum. This is okay because any amount of people can have the same salary. An example of a bad contraint is having Id numbers range from 1-10, limiting the amount of entries in the table since it shouls be a one to one relationship.
