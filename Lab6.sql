--A LEFT OUTER JOIN will return all rows from the left table and return any matching rows from the right table if there are any. A RIGHT OUTER JOIN will return all frows from the right table and return any matching rows from the left table if there any 

-- The LEFT OUTER JOIN below returns all customers in the customers table and any customers who placed an order but it also returns Weyland, the only customer who did not place an order
Select customers.name 
From customers Left OUTER JOIN orders on orders.cid=customers.cid

--This RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all customers who placed an order AND are in the customers table. Therefore, if a customer did not place an order their name will not appear in this query 
Select customers.name
From customers RIGHT OUTER JOIN orders on orders.cid=customers.cid
